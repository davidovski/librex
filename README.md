> LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine, made by [hnhx](https://github.com/hnhx). LibreY changed some features like automatic redirection (now instance fallback), added scrapers for more search engines and various other changes visible in the [commit log](https://github.com/hnhx/librex/compare/main...Ahwxorg:LibreY:main). The original code is written by [hnhx and contributors](https://github.com/hnhx/LibreX/contributors)

### How to host LibreY

[This section has been moved](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/tree/main/docs) to clear up some README space.

### About LibreY

LibreY gives you text results from Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, Ecosia, Yandex Search and Mojeek. LibreY provides images from Qwant, and torrents from i.e. Ahmia and popular torrent sites. LibreY does this without spying on you.
<br>LibreY doesn't save **any** type of data about the user, there are no logs (except NGINX logs if the host sets them).
